non-web-based-presentations
===========================

Set of presentations that we have given that were not in a web-based format. 

Some of these presentations were originally presented using Apple Keynote so the PDF may not appear correctly due to the transitions that were used.

To accomodate this, all Keynote files were also included. The same goes for Microsoft Powerpoint.
